I am a 3rd year PhD student at the [EIS Lab (INI, UZH/ETHZ)](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/EIS.html) supervised by Prof. [Melika Payvand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ol_9mKgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for real-time processing of multi-timescale signals. By tightly coupling algorithm design with hardware constraints, I pursue hardwareâ€“software co-design approaches that aim for peak computational efficiency.

The human brain serves as a model of efficiency and inspires my exploration of biologically grounded inductive biases in neural architecture design. I investigate how dendritic mechanisms, including delayed signal propagation [DenRAM](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47764-w) and selective dendritic gating [mGRADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01829), can be leveraged to build more efficient and temporally aware computational models.
